    <li style="color:rgb(255,0,0)"><h3>Alexstrasza the Life-Binder, former Aspect of the red dragonflight, is the guardian of all life in the world of Azeroth. She was one of five great dragons chosen by the titans to be empowered with a portion of the Pantheon's power and rule over her flight while they watched over Azeroth and its inhabitants. The titans also appointed her queen of all dragons.</li>
    <li style="color:rgb(0,0,255)"><h3>Malygos was the Aspect of the blue dragonflight and one of the most ancient creatures living on Azeroth and the eldest of the Aspects. Norgannon, the titan master-magician and keeper of lore, granted Malygos a portion of his vast power. From then on, Malygos would be known as the Spell-weaver, the guardian of arcane magic and hidden arcanum.</li>
    <li style="color:rgb(0,255,0)"><h3>Ysera is the former Dragon Aspect of the green dragonflight, charged with keeping watch over the flowering wilds of Azeroth from within the Emerald Dream. Bound to this ethereal realm, she descended into an endless trance and became known thereafter as the Dreamer. Ysera, now nicknamed the Awakened,  though she was not yet able to consistently tell the difference between dream and reality; while she was still sane, she was not yet entirely coherent.</li>
    <li style="color:rgb(244,251,4)"><h3>Nozdormu the Timeless One, aspect of the bronze dragonflight and guardian of time, is one of the former Dragon Aspects empowered by the titans to watch over Azeroth. He fought against the demons during the War of the Ancients. Following this intervention, he retreated into seclusion, immersing himself in his duties. He emerges only infrequently, when events require his direct presence. He intervened in the defeat of Deathwing at the hands of Krasus and his allies, one of the few times he has been seen in the skies of Azeroth.</li>
    <li style="color:rgb(144,30,6)"><h3>Deathwing the Destroyer, formerly known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder (pronounced "nehl-THAW-ree-uhn"), was one of the five Dragon Aspects and leader of the black dragonflight. Ages ago, Neltharion was empowered by the Pantheon with dominion over the earth and the deep places of Azeroth. However, driven mad by the Old Gods, he turned against the other Aspects during the War of the Ancients, eventually abandoning his title of Aspect of Earth in favor of being the Aspect of Death. Becoming one of the greatest terrors of the known world, his name too became one whispered with a feeling of fear and contempt among both mortals and dragons. He was perhaps the most powerful servant of the Old Gods.</li>
